                <br></br><p class="Paragraph1">I am a passionate, highly motivated IT professional with a growing expertise in software development and systems implementation. My technical journey is fueled by curiosity, sharpened by hands-on experience, and defined by a clear goal to build meaningful, innovative solutions that make life easier for users and operations more efficient for organizations.
                  My most recent experience was at Infobytes Solutions Inc., where I served as a Technical Specialist for six months a period that proved to be both transformative and rewarding. 
                </p>
                <br></br><p class="Paragraph1">During my time there, I was not only responsible for providing day-to-day technical support and system maintenance, but I was also mentored and trained extensively by senior developers and managers to advance my skills as a software developer.This experience gave me deep insight into real-world software development workflows, project lifecycles, and best practices in delivering impactful IT solutions. I was entrusted with major responsibilities early on, and I embraced the challenge. One of my most significant accomplishments was the design and implementation of a Purchase Monitoring System using Excel Macros and VBA.</p>

              <div class="Aboutme2">
                <p class="Paragraph2">This custom-built system automated the company’s procurement tracking process — reducing manual errors, increasing visibility across departments, and saving countless hours of administrative work. I also led the development of a Document Tracking System built with Microsoft Visual Studio, which streamlined document flow within the organization and introduced an efficient way to manage, trace, and safeguard critical files. Both systems were successfully adopted and continue to contribute to operational improvements.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p class="Paragraph2">Beyond my technical skills, I bring a strong sense of initiative and a drive to continuously improve. I’m comfortable working independently, but I thrive even more in collaborative environments where ideas are shared, problems are solved together, and innovation is encouraged. My skill set includes technologies like Python, JavaScript, Visual Basic, PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, C#, and Excel VBA, which I continue to refine through projects and self-directed learning.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p class="Paragraph3">Beyond software development, I have solid experience in troubleshooting internet connectivity, diagnosing LAN and network-related issues, and ensuring smooth operations across both physical and cloud environments. I have managed user accounts and permissions through Active Directory, performed administrative tasks such as password resets and policy enforcement, and supported onboarding and offboarding processes efficiently.</p>

              <p class="Paragraph4">I also leveraged Robocopy for automated, high-speed file transfers and migrations, ensuring data integrity and security during system transitions, backups, and cross-network transfers. These tools were instrumental in maintaining seamless file management operations, especially during server maintenance or department migrations.</p>
              <br></br><p class="Paragraph4">If you're seeking a passionate and reliable developer or IT specialist who is not only technically capable but also deeply committed to contributing value I would be excited to be part of your team and help move your vision forward.</p>
